                            </header>

                            <p>The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Annual Symposium was held in Washington, D.C. from Saturday November 16 to Wednesday, November 20. There were approximately 2500 attendees, about 400 of whom were students. The conference itself was a whirlwind, so I'd like to take some time to reflect on the experiences I had and the people I got to meet.</p>

                            <p>One of the highlights for me was the opening keynote presentation on Sunday, November 17. The speaker was Captain Hassan A. Tetteh, MD, MBA. He opened his talk with a short video about going to retrieve an organ for a transplant. The video shared an honorable, human experience: getting up in the middle of the night to do a job that would save someone's life.  The idea of human care was a key theme for the rest of his talk. </p>

                            <p>He shared the history of human care by relating a story of  to the Temple of Ascelpius on the isle of Kos. Around 400 BC, a man in white who was experiencing chest pains went to the Temple. On his way in, he saw someone outside the temple caring for some sick people. When he went into the temple, he paid a large sum of money to sleep in the temple overnight, still in pain. The next morning, the temple workers asked the man if he had received any dreams that told him how to fix what was wrong with him. The man had not. He left the temple, dejected, and came upon the man in white from the day before outside the temple. The man in white asked to help him. He said he had no more money to give and he didn't know what the man in white could offer that the priests in the temple could not. The man in white said "They do not practice the same medicine as I do." The two men sat and talked. The man in white asked about his health, his father's heath, his sleep, his diet, his stress, and so on. He told the man with chest pains to change his diet, make more time to relax, and work less or he would die. The man with chest pains did as he was told and lived for a number of years. Turns out, the man in white was Hippocrates. Hippocrates was able to help the man with chest pains because he looked at the patient as a whole person and treated him with care.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Tetteh then shared a personal story about his experience as a patient in college similar to that of the man with chest pains. The ER doctor who diagnosed him treated him as a human, not just a body in a bed. This experience helped develop Dr. Tetteh's philosophy of "human care" theory. He ended by talking about how medical informatics is a powerful field for supporting doctors in practicing human care.</p>

                            <p>Another impactful session was Dr. Jim Cimino's Year In Review on Monday, November 18. I was excited that the talk began with biomedical imaging papers - biomedical imaging is so rarely represented at AMIA! Dr. Cimino gave brief overviews of impactful papers in different medical informatics fields, including papers on constructing a sleep data commons, the PRIDE study (engaging sexual and gender minorities in medical informatics research), a content analysis of healthcare data scientist job postings, conversational agents in healthcare, ensemble models for nested adverse event detection (NLP), and adversarial attacks on medical machine learning. The three key takeaway points from Dr. Cimino's talk are that more systematic reviews are being rated as significant, significant work crosses working group lines, and more work is being done with a focus on the patient.</p>

                            <p>Outside of the sessions, I had the opportunity to meet with members of the AMIA Student Work Group and the Medical Imaging Work Group. In both of these meetings, group members talked about group expansion and inclusion, helping people make connections in other work groups, and engaging their communities with conversations about important topics. It was nice to watch the work group leaders take Dr. Cimino's suggestion about crossing working group lines to heart. </p>

                            <p>The final program offered by the AMIA Annual Symposium I want to include in my highlights is the High School Scholars (HSS) program. A total of 13 high school students were accepted into this program - 6 oral presentations and 7 posters. Each high school student was matched with a graduate student mentor for the day on Monday, November 18. The mentors and students attended both morning and the first afternoon sessions together before going to the HSS oral presentations at 3:30 pm. They spoke eloquently about the medical informatics work they had performed under the guidance of a PhD or PhD student at an academic lab.  To say these students are impressive is a massive understatement - one student's presentation even included deep learning! </p>

                            <p>Side note: this is the third year I have participated in the HSS program, and it might be my favorite part of the AMIA Annual Conference. The student I mentored in my first year is now in her sophomore year of college studying biology with an interest in computer science. One of the students I mentored last year returned to AMIA this year as a high school junior. She excitedly told me how she had finished the SATs and would be prepping for a biology test after the conference was done for the day. Her passion for STEM and learning was a refreshing change of pace from the regular conference schedule.</p>

                            <p>There were many other exciting presentations and panels at the symposium. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend all of them, but I am glad I was able to go to those I did!</p>
